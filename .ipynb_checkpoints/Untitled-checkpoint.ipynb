    "A very interesting application of probability in computer science is a kind of data structures which have a probabilistic behaviour. Examples of these are **Bloom filter**, **Skip list**, **Count-min sketch** and **HyperLogLog**.\n",

    "* What is a data structure? \n",
    "* What is a probabilistic data structure?\n",
    "    * Where does the probabilistic behaviour emerge?\n",
    "    * What advantages do these structures provide?\n",
    "* For your chosen structure, how is it constructed?\n",
    "    * What parts do you need? What are the details?\n",
    "* How does the structure work?\n",
    "    * What operations can you do?\n",
    "    * What are the typical probabilities associated with these operations?\n",
    "* Analyze the structure\n",
    "    * Analyze the runtimes for all operations\n",
    "    * Analyze the space usage\n",
    "    * Compare to a similar, non-probabilistic data structure\n",
    "    * What advantages does the new data structure have? What drawbacks do you need to be aware of?\n",
    "* Give at least one example where this structure is useful\n",
    "    * E.g. Bloom filter - spell checkers\n",
    "    * Analyze the use case\n",
    "    * If possible, implement the use case\n",

Generally speaking, these data structures use hash functions to randomize and compactly represent a set of items. Collisions are ignored but errors can be well-controlled under certain threshold. Comparing with error-free approaches, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time. They usually support union and intersection operations and therefore can be easily parallelized."
