    "The simple answer to this question is that probabilistic data structures provide us with an approximate solution, which may or may not be the exact answer, but it's close to the real one. They rely on some form of probablity such as using randomness, hasing, and etc to reach that approximate solution also they are proven to use either a fixed or sublinear memory and have constant execution time."

    "Because of their probabilsitc behaviour and the fact that they don't give you an exact answer, instead they provide you with a reasonable approximation of the it and a way to approximate this estimation, that's why they are extremely useful for big data and streaming application because they allow to dramatically decrease the amount of memory needed (in comparison to data structures that give you exact answers). Another advantage is that, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time and usually support union and intersection operations, so they can be easily parallelized.\n",

In those cases the second item doesn't change it array position value, but the first item would have set its value as 1. Therefore in these cases even if the element isn't presented in the set, its existence is returned as 1. For example, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually it’s not.\n",

    "To illustrate it more clearlu, I will demonstrate an example below.\n",

    "First of all an empty bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all set to zero, like these one:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter1.png\">\n",

For example, let's suppose we want to enter the word **“geeks”** in the filter. We are using **3** hash functions and a bit array of length **10**, all set to **0** initially. First we’ll calculate the hashes as following:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <b>\n",
    "    h1(\"geeks\") % 10 = 1 <br>\n",
    "    h1(\"geeks\") % 10 = 4 <br>\n",
    "    h1(\"geeks\") % 10 = 7 <br>\n",
    "    </b>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to set the elements on **positions 1**, **4** and **7** to **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we want to enter a word. First we will calculate the hashes.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <b>\n",
    "    h1(“nerd”) % 10 = 3 <br>\n",
    "    h2(“nerd”) % 10 = 5 <br>\n",
    "    h3(“nerd”) % 10 = 4 <br>\n",
    "    </b>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will set the indexes on **positions 3**, **5** and **4** to **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we want to check if **“geeks”** is present in filter or not. We’ll do the same process but this time in **reverse order**. We calculate respective hashes using h1, h2 and h3 and check if all these indexes are set to **1** in the bit array. If all the bits are set then we can say that “geeks” **is probably present**. If any of the bit at these indexes are **0** then “geeks” **is definitely not present**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why do we called it probably present. Is it uncertain? Let's suppose we want to check whether “cat” is present or not. We’ll calculate hashes using h1, h2 and h3.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <b>\n",
    "    h1(“cat”) % 10 = 1 <br>\n",
    "    h2(“cat”) % 10 = 3 <br>\n",
    "    h3(“cat”) % 10 = 7 <br>\n",
    "    </b>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we check the bit array, bits at these indexes are set to 1 but we know that “cat” was never added to the filter. Bit at index 1 and 7 was set when we added “geeks” and bit 3 was set, when we added “nerd”.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, because bits at calculated indexes are already set by some other item, bloom filter erroneously claim that “cat” is present and generating a false positive result. Depending on the application, it could be huge downside or relatively okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can control the probability of getting a false positive by controlling the size of the Bloom filter. More space means fewer false positives. If we want to decrease the probability of false positive result, we have to use more number of hash functions and larger bit array. This would add latency in addition of item and checking membership. \n",

    "### Blooms' Filter performance\n",
    "A Bloom filter with one hash function is equivalent to ordinary hashing. Bloom filter is a generalization of hashing. It allows for more interesting design tradeoffs. The complexity to add an element or to query the filter is fixed. In other words, it's independent of how many items have been added to the filter. Bloom filter simplifies some operations. Suppose we have two filters to represents sets S1 and S2. The union of the these two sets is simply an OR operation of the two filters. Intersection of the two sets can also be approximated with the filters. Another trick is to half the size of the filter with an OR operation of the first and second halves of the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space advantages\n",
    "Bloom filter have a spectacular space advantage over other data strucuture for representing sets, such as self-balancing binary search trees, tries, hash tables, or simple arrays or linked lists of the entries. Most of these data structures are storing at least the data items in themselves, but bloom filter don't store the data items at all. For example linked data structures require additional space, where a bloom filter with 1% error and k optimal value, need only 9.6 bits per element, regardless the size of the element. This advantage of the bloom filter is partly inherited from the arrays and from its probabilistic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, if the number of potential values is small, the Bloom filter is easily surpassed by the deterministic bit array, which requires only one bit for each potential element. Hash tables gain a space and time advantage if they begin ignoring collisions and store only whether each bucket contains an value, in this case, they have effectively become Bloom filters with k = 1.\n",

    "#### Time advantages\n",
    "Bloom filters also have the unusual property that the time needed either to add items or to check whether an item is in the set is a fixed constant (O(k)) completely independent of the number of items already in the set. No other constant-space set data structure has this property, but the average access time of sparse hash tables can make them faster in practice than some Bloom filters. In a hardware implementation, however, the Bloom filter shines because its k lookups are independent and can be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand its space efficiency, it is instructive to compare the general Bloom filter with its special case when k = 1. If k = 1, then in order to keep the false positive rate sufficiently low, a small fraction of bits should be set, which means the array must be very large and contain long runs of zeros. The information content of the array relative to its size is low. The generalized Bloom filter (k greater than 1) allows many more bits to be set while still maintaining a low false positive rate, if the parameters (k and m) are chosen well, about half of the bits will be set, and these will be apparently random, minimizing redundancy and maximizing information content.\n",

    "### Comparing Bloom Filter with another non-probabilistic data structure\n",
    "I chose to compare the Bloom Filter with HashTable\n",
    "\n",
    "HashTable is a data strucuture, which stores key-value pairs (like dicitionaries in python). The way it works is that the key is sent to a hash function, which performs arithhmetic operations on it and after that they return the hash value, which is used as the index for accessing the key-value pair in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How they store objects?\n",
    "    * HashTable store objects by their index.\n",
    "    * Bloom Filter don't store the objects. He tells only if the object is present or not.\n",
    "2. How much space do they take?\n",
    "    * Because of the fact that all string must map to ceratin location, HashTables are less space efficient.\n",
    "    * Because Bloom Filters are just an arrays of 0s and 1s, they are more space efficient.\n",
    "3. How accurate are they?\n",
    "    * HashTables give more accurate results.\n",
    "    * Bloom Filters have small false positive probability.\n",
    "4. Do they support deletion operations?\n",
    "    * HashTables support deletion, as they mark the object location as NULL. \n",
    "    * Bloom Filters don't support deletion. If you want to delete an item, you need to restart the filter.\n",
    "5. How do they deal with collisions?\n",
    "    * HashTables have to minimize the collisions, so you must choose multiple hashes or a strong hash.\n",
    "    * There is no need to handle collisions, as the Bloom Filter is using many hash functions.\n",
    "6. What are they used for?\n",
    "    * Hashmaps are used in compiler operations, programming languages(hash table based data structures),password verification, etc.\n",
    "    * Bloom Filters have application in network routers, in web browsers(detecting malicious URLs),in existing username checkers, in password checkers etc."

This probability can vary, but oftentimes 1/2 is used. Additionally, the first node in the linked list is often always kept, as a header for the new layer. On average, each element appears in 1/(1-p) lists, and the tallest element (usually a special head element at the front of the skip list) in all the lists.

    "### Working with Skip List\n",
    "The idea is simple, we create multiple layers so that we can skip some nodes. The lower layer is a common line that links all nodes, and the top layer is an express line that links only the main nodes. If you search for a number (n), you will start from the first node of the express line and continue running on the express line until you find a node that is equl or more than n, when you find that node you will go to the normal line and search again for n. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to understand the working of the skip list, see the picture below, a list with 16 nodes and two layers. The upper layer works as an “express lane” which connects only main outer stations, and the lower layer works as a “normal lane” which connects every station. Let's suppose, that we want to search for 50, we start from the first node of “express lane” and keep moving on “express lane” till we find a node whose next is greater than 50. Once we find such a node (30 is the node in following example) on “express lane”, we move to “normal lane” using pointer from this node, and linearly search for 50 on “normal lane”. In following example, we start from 30 on “normal lane” and with linear search, we find 50.\n",
