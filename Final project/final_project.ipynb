    "## What is data structure?\n",

    "Probabilistic data structures are a group of data structures that are extremely useful for big data and streaming applications. By using them, we get an approximately solution, which may or may not be the exact answer, but it's close to it. Probablistic data structure will rely on some form of probablity such as using randomness, hasing, and etc to reach an approximate solution also they are proven to use either a fixed or sublinear memory and have constant execution time. Comparing with error-free approaches, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time. They usually support union and intersection operations and therefore can be easily parallelized."

    "First of all an empty bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all set to zero, like that one:<br>\n",
    "<img style=\"width:50%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter1.png\"><br>\n",
    "For us, to calculate the hashes for a given input, we will need k number of hash functions.When we want to add an item in the filter, the bits at k indices h1(x), h2(x), … hk(x) are set, where indices are calculated using hash functions.<br>\n",
    "For example, let's suppose we want to enter the word “geeks” in the filter. We are using 3 hash functions and a bit array of length 10, all set to 0 initially. First we’ll calculate the hashes as following :<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>h1(\"geeks\") % 10 = 1 <br>\n",
    "h1(\"geeks\") % 10 = 4 <br>\n",
    "h1(\"geeks\") % 10 = 7</center><br>\n",

    "Now we are going to set the indexes on positions 1, 4 and 7 to 1.<br>\n",
    "<img style=\"width:50%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we want to enter a word, for example. First we will calculate the hashes.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>h1(“nerd”) % 10 = 3<br>\n",
    "h2(“nerd”) % 10 = 5<br>\n",
    "h3(“nerd”) % 10 = 4</center><br>\n",

    "<img style=\"width:50%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we want to check “geeks” is present in filter or not. We’ll do the same process but this time in reverse order. We calculate respective hashes using h1, h2 and h3 and check if all these indices are set to 1 in the bit array. If all the bits are set then we can say that “geeks” is probably present. If any of the bit at these indices are 0 then “geeks” is definitely not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why do we called it probably present. Isn't it uncertain? Let's suppose we want to check whether “cat” is present or not. We’ll calculate hashes using h1, h2 and h3.\n",

    "<center>h1(“cat”) % 10 = 1<br>\n",
    "h2(“cat”) % 10 = 3<br>\n",
    "h3(“cat”) % 10 = 7</center>\n",
    "\n",

    "<img style=\"width:50%;\" src=\"Images/bloom_filter4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, because bits at calculated indices are already set by some other item, bloom filter erroneously claim that “cat” is present and generating a false positive result. Depending on the application, it could be huge downside or relatively okay.\n",
    "We can control the probability of getting a false positive by controlling the size of the Bloom filter. More space means fewer false positives. If we want decrease probability of false positive result, we have to use more number of hash functions and larger bit array. This would add latency in addition of item and checking membership. "

    "## Space and time advantages\n",
    "While risking false positives, Bloom filters have a substantial space advantage over other data structures for representing sets, such as self-balancing binary search trees, tries, hash tables, or simple arrays or linked lists of the entries. Most of these require storing at least the data items themselves, which can require anywhere from a small number of bits, for small integers, to an arbitrary number of bits, such as for strings (tries are an exception since they can share storage between elements with equal prefixes). However, Bloom filters do not store the data items at all, and a separate solution must be provided for the actual storage. Linked structures incur an additional linear space overhead for pointers. A Bloom filter with a 1% error and an optimal value of k, in contrast, requires only about 9.6 bits per element, regardless of the size of the elements. This advantage comes partly from its compactness, inherited from arrays, and partly from its probabilistic nature. The 1% false-positive rate can be reduced by a factor of ten by adding only about 4.8 bits per element.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the number of potential values is small and many of them can be in the set, the Bloom filter is easily surpassed by the deterministic bit array, which requires only one bit for each potential element. Hash tables gain a space and time advantage if they begin ignoring collisions and store only whether each bucket contains an entry; in this case, they have effectively become Bloom filters with k = 1."

    "Bloom filters also have the unusual property that the time needed either to add items or to check whether an item is in the set is a fixed constant, O(k), completely independent of the number of items already in the set. No other constant-space set data structure has this property, but the average access time of sparse hash tables can make them faster in practice than some Bloom filters. In a hardware implementation, however, the Bloom filter shines because its k lookups are independent and can be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand its space efficiency, it is instructive to compare the general Bloom filter with its special case when k = 1. If k = 1, then in order to keep the false positive rate sufficiently low, a small fraction of bits should be set, which means the array must be very large and contain long runs of zeros. The information content of the array relative to its size is low. The generalized Bloom filter (k greater than 1) allows many more bits to be set while still maintaining a low false positive rate; if the parameters (k and m) are chosen well, about half of the bits will be set,[5] and these will be apparently random, minimizing redundancy and maximizing information content."

    "\n",
    "Then, another layer is added on top of the bottom list. This new layer will include any given element from the previous layer with probability p.p. This probability can vary, but oftentimes 1/2 is used. Additionally, the first node in the linked list is often always kept, as a header for the new layer. Take a look at the following graphics and see how some elements are kept but others are discarded. Here, it just so happened that half of the elements are kept in each new layer, but it could be more or less--it's all probabilistic. In all cases, each new layer is still ordered.\n",
