    "Probabilistic data structures are a group of data structures that are extremely useful for big data and streaming applications. By using them, we get an approximately solution, which may or may not be the exact answer, but it's close to it. Probablistic data structure will rely on some form of probablity such as using randomness, hasing, and etc to reach an approximate solution also they are proven to use either a fixed or sublinear memory and have constant execution time. Comparing with error-free approaches, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time. They usually support union and intersection operations and therefore can be easily parallelized."

If any of the bit at these indices are 0 then “geeks” is definitely not present.\n",

Most of these data structures are storing at least the data items in themselves, but bloom filter don't store the data items at all. For example linked data structures require additional space, where a bloom filter with 1% error and k optimal value, need only 9.6 bits per element, regardless the size of the element. This advantage of the bloom filter is partly inherited from the arrays and from its probabilistic nature.\n",

    "Bloom filters also have the unusual property that the time needed either to add items or to check whether an item is in the set is a fixed constant, O(k), completely independent of the number of items already in the set. No other constant-space set data structure has this property, but the average access time of sparse hash tables can make them faster in practice than some Bloom filters. In a hardware implementation, however, the Bloom filter shines because its k lookups are independent and can be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand its space efficiency, it is instructive to compare the general Bloom filter with its special case when k = 1. If k = 1, then in order to keep the false positive rate sufficiently low, a small fraction of bits should be set, which means the array must be very large and contain long runs of zeros. The information content of the array relative to its size is low. The generalized Bloom filter (k greater than 1) allows many more bits to be set while still maintaining a low false positive rate; if the parameters (k and m) are chosen well, about half of the bits will be set,[5] and these will be apparently random, minimizing redundancy and maximizing information content."

    "I chose to compare the Bloom Filter with HashTable\n",
    "\n",
    "HashTable is a data strucuture, which stores key-value pairs (like dicitionaries in python). The way it works is that the key is sent to a hash function, which performs arithhmetic operations on it and after that they return the hash value, which is used as the index for accessing the key-value pair in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How they store objects?\n",
    "    * HashTable store objects by their index.\n",
    "    * Bloom Filter don't store the objects. He tells only if the object is present or not.\n",
    "2. How much space do they take?\n",
    "    * Because of the fact that all string must map to ceratin location, HashTables are less space efficient.\n",
    "    * Because Bloom Filters are just an arrays of 0s and 1s, they are more space efficient.\n",
    "3. How accurate are they?\n",
    "    * HashTables give more accurate results.\n",
    "    * Bloom Filters have small false positive probability.\n",
    "4. Do they support deletion operations?\n",
    "    * HashTables support deletion, as they mark the object location as NULL. \n",
    "    * Bloom Filters don't support deletion. If you want to delete an item, you need to restart the filter.\n",
    "5. How do they deal with collisions?\n",
    "    * HashTables have to minimize the collisions, so you must choose multiple hashes or a strong hash.\n",
    "    * There is no need to handle collisions, as the Bloom Filter is using many hash functions.\n",
    "6. What are they used for?\n",
    "    * Hashmaps are used in compiler operations, programming languages(hash table based data structures),password verification, etc.\n",
    "    * Bloom Filters have application in network routers, in web browsers(detecting malicious URLs),in existing username checkers, in password checkers etc."

    "The skip list is a probabilisitc data structure that is built upon the general idea of a linked list. The skip list uses probability to build subsequent layers of linked lists upon an original linked list. Each additional layer of links contains fewer elements, but no new elements."

    "The lowest layer of the skip list is a common sorted linked list, and the top layers of the skip list are like an \"express line\" where the elements are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "A skip list starts with a basic, ordered, linked list. This list is sorted, but we can't do a binary search on it because it is a linked list and we cannot index into it. But the ordering will come in handy later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, another layer is added on top of the bottom list. This new layer will include any given element from the previous layer with probability p.p. This probability can vary, but oftentimes 1/2 is used. Additionally, the first node in the linked list is often always kept, as a header for the new layer. Take a look at the following graphics and see how some elements are kept but others are discarded. Here, it just so happened that half of the elements are kept in each new layer, but it could be more or less--it's all probabilistic. In all cases, each new layer is still ordered.\n",

    "### Deciding nodes level\n",
    "While inserting an element in the list, it is represented by a node, which is chosen randomly. The level doesn't depend on the number of elements in the node. Also another important term is max level, which is the upper bound on number of levels of the skip list. It could be calculated as:\n",

    "### Working\n",
    "The idea is simple, we create multiple layers so that we can skip some nodes. See the following example list with 16 nodes and two layers. The upper layer works as an “express lane” which connects only main outer stations, and the lower layer works as a “normal lane” which connects every station. Suppose we want to search for 50, we start from first node of “express lane” and keep moving on “express lane” till we find a node whose next is greater than 50. Once we find such a node (30 is the node in following example) on “express lane”, we move to “normal lane” using pointer from this node, and linearly search for 50 on “normal lane”. In following example, we start from 30 on “normal lane” and with linear search, we find 50.\n",

    "Let's take an example to understand the working of the skip list. In this example, we have 14 nodes, such that these nodes are divided into two layers, as shown in the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower layer is a common line that links all nodes, and the top layer is an express line that links only the main nodes, as you can see in the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to find 47 in this example. You will start the search from the first node of the express line and continue running on the express line until you find a node that is equal a 47 or more than 47.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in the example that 47 does not exist in the express line, so you search for a node of less than 47, which is 40. Now, you go to the normal line with the help of 40, and search the 47, as shown in the diagram."
