    "### What is data structure?\n",
    "In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data."

    "### What is a probabilistic data structure?\n",
    "Probabilistic data structures are a group of data structures that are extremely useful for big data and streaming applications. Generally speaking, these data structures use hash functions to randomize and compactly represent a set of items. Collisions are ignored but errors can be well-controlled under certain threshold. Comparing with error-free approaches, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time. They usually support union and intersection operations and therefore can be easily parallelized."

    "#### What advantages do these structures provide?\n",
    "Probabilistic data structures can't give you a definite answer, instead they provide you with a reasonable approximation of the answer and a way to approximate this estimation. They are extremely useful for big data and streaming application because they allow to dramatically decrease the amount of memory needed (in comparison to data structures that give you exact answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "In majority of the cases these data structures use hash functions to randomize the items. Because they ignore collisions they keep the size constant, but this is also a reason why they can't give you exact values. The advantages they bring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- they use small amount of memory (you can control how much)\n",
    "- they can be easily parallelizable (hashes are independent)\n",

    "The Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.  The price we pay for efficiency is that it is probabilistic in nature that means, there might be some False Positive results. False positive means, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually it’s not. Bloom filters are both fast and space-efficient. However, elements can only be added, not removed.\n",

    "An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all set to 0. There are also k different hash functions, each of which maps a set element to one of the m bit positions.\n",
    "* To add an element, feed it to the hash functions to get k bit positions, and set the bits at these positions to 1.\n",
    "* To test if an element is in the set, feed it to the hash functions to get k bit positions.\n",
    "    * If any of the bits at these positions is 0, the element definitely isn’t the set.\n",

When we want to add an item in the filter, the bits at k indices h1(x), h2(x), … hk(x) are set, where indices are calculated using hash functions. Example – Suppose we want to enter “geeks” in the filter, we are using 3 hash functions and a bit array of length 10, all set to 0 initially. First we’ll calculate the hashes as following :  "
